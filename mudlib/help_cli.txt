DemiMUD is a prototype MUD engine written in Rust. See '`Whelp demimud`^' for more
information about it.

This CLI takes DemiMUD and turns it into a simple single-player REPL, akin to
an Interactive Fiction game.

It is mostly meant to be compiled to WASM/WASI as a way to show off its
features.

WASI support for non-blocking reads (especially on https://webassembly.sh) is
currently pretty poor. Because of this, time passes only when pressing enter.

Because some mobs have delays between their interactions, the CLI scans all
mobs in the player's room and checks if they have queued commands; if they do,
the prompt will show "press enter".

Pressing enter without any command will advance time by up to 100 ticks until
at least one message is printed to the player, or mobs no longer have queued
events. Pressing enter with a command will always advance time by just 1 tick.
