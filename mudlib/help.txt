`m# Looking`^

You can '`Wlook`^' (or just '`Wl`^' for short) to examine the room you are in. You can
also look at a specific object, NPC, player, or at certain things in the room
description, for example '`Wlook bench`^' or '`Wlook dog`^'.

`m# Movement`^

Examine your room to see what exits are available; you can move between rooms
by using the name of the exit as a command.

The common exits are '`Wnorth`^', '`Weast`^', '`Wsouth`^', '`Wwest`^', '`Wup`^', and '`Wdown`^'. These
can all be abbreviated to the first letter of their word ('`Wn`^', '`We`^', etc).

If you are lost, the '`Wmap`^' command will generate a map based on the current
room to help with navigation, or you can '`Wrecall`^' to one of the well-known
places.

`m# Communication`^

Use '`Wsay <message>`^' to say something that will be heard by all players in your
current room.

There are also various emotes you can use, like '`Wnod`^', '`Wsmile`^', etc. They
can be used either own their own, or with a target (for example '`Wpoint gnome`^').

The '`Wemotes`^' command will show the list of emotes, and giving it the name of
an emote will show what messages it would echo to people in the room.

To target yourself with an emote, either use your name or me/self/myself.

`m# Inventory`^

Each player and mobile has an inventory to store items; to check what items you
are holding, use '`Winventory`^' (or '`Winv`^' or '`Wi`^' for short).

To pick up or drop items from the ground, use '`Wget <name>`^' and '`Wdrop <name>`^'.

`m# Administrative commands`^

Use '`Wwho`^' to check who is in the realm. You can '`Wrestart`^' and '`Wshutdown`^' the
whole server as well, and also crash it with the '`Wpanic`^' command.
