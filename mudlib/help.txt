`m# Looking`^

You can '`Wlook`^' (or just '`Wl`^' for short) to examine the room you are in. You can
also look at a specific object, NPC, player, or at certain things in the room
description, for example '`Wlook bench`^' or '`Wlook dog`^'.

`m# Movement`^

Examine your room to see what exits are available; you can move between rooms
by using the name of the exit as a command.

The common exits are '`Wnorth`^', '`Weast`^', '`Wsouth`^', '`Wwest`^', '`Wup`^', and '`Wdown`^'. These
can all be abbreviated to the first letter of their word ('`Wn`^', '`We`^', etc).

`m# Communication`^

Use '`Wsay <message>`^' to say something that will be heard by all players in your
current room.

There are also a list of socials you can use, like '`Wnod`^', '`Wsmile`^', etc.

`m# Administrative commands`^

Use '`Wwho`^' to check who is in the realm. You can '`Wrestart`^' and '`Wexit`^' the whole
server as well.
