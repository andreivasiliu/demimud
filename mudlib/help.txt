This is DemiMUD, a basic area loader that lets you explore the world of Dawn of
Time, although with a very limited experience.

Currently it implements less than 1% of Dawn of Time's features. See more at:
https://github.com/andreivasiliu/demimud

See also: `Whelp commands`^, `Whelp demimud`^, `Whelp credits`^, `Whelp cli`^, `Whelp emote`^.

If you are lost, type '`Wrecall mudschool`^'. Currently DemiMUD has enough logic
to support the first 13 rooms of Dawn of Time's MudSchool, which will teach you
most of the commands implemented in DemiMUD so far.
