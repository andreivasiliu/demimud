DemiMUD's codebase is implemented from scratch, and is able to load the Dawn
of Time MUD's area files via reverse engineering and with help from SMAUG's
documentation files (which laregely still apply as both are DikuMUD
derivatives).

The codebase is distributed via the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0. See
the LICENSE file at: https://github.com/andreivasiliu/demimud

The WASM/WASI binary, however, also includes area files taken from the Dawn of
Time MUD, by Michael Garratt (c) 1997-2004. See the http://www.dawnoftime.org/
website for more information (possibly on archive.org if it is down).

Credits for each area file are listed with the '`Wareas`^' command.

Dawn of Time is based on Based on Diku by Hans Katya, Tom, Michael, and
Sebastian, MERC 2.1 by Hatchet, Furey and Kahn ROM 2.4 (c)1993-1996 by Russ
Taylor, Oblivion 2.0 (C)1996-97 by Wes Wagner.

Although DemiMUD does not include any code or areas from the MUDs Dawn of Time
is based on, it would not be what it is without their heroic efforts.
