DemiMUD is a prototype MUD engine written in Rust.

The code is available on an LGPL-3.0 license at:
https://github.com/andreivasiliu/demimud

DemiMUD's codebase is written completely from scratch, and is not derived from
Dawn of Time or any other DikuMUD derivatives, although it is inspired by their
look and feel, and could not exist without them.

Area, object and NPC descriptions are imported from Dawn of Time v.16r, which
was made by Michael Garratt (c) 1997-2004. For a full list of credits, see the
`Whelp credits`^ command. See https://www.dawnoftime.org/ (on archive.org if
it is down).

Currently only about 20 commands are supported (movement and basic object
interaction with no stats, combat, etc), and has less than 1% of the features
of Dawn of Time. If you wish to try DoT, see the website linked above (note
that downloads of .tgz/.zip archives are possible on archive.org as well).

If you're playing this via WASM, see '`Whelp cli`^'.
