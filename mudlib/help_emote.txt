`m# Emoting`^

Did you actually expect me to write this help file? Because I did.

Besides the pre-defined '`Wsocials`^', '`Wemote <text>`^' and '`Wpmote <target> <text>`^'
can be used to echo custom messages to those in the same room. Other people
will see your name followed by the text, and a period if you didn't put one.
Example: '`Wemote waves his arms wildly.`^'

Both support '`W*`^' that switches the place your name is at. It can also be used
to remove the space between your name and the rest of the text.
Example: '`Wemote *'s eyes shine brightly.`^'

'`Wpmote <target>`^' furthermore supports '`W@`^' that will be replaced with "you"
for the target, or the target's name for everyone else.
Example: '`Wpmote gnome * glances at @.`^'

The '`Wemote`^' command also has an alias, '`W,`^' (a comma), which can be used
without a space after it.
Example: '`W,nods`^'
